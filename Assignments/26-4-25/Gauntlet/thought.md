Thought:

see in this code, actually we think to get in the given order, but we get in a proper order, that works as the javascript helping to do..

JS will convert the keys, even if they are in numerical type will computed as the  `Numeric string key`

and then ot make to iterate over them in a proper order, like first the numeric string keys get iterated, then normal string keys will get in to iteration.
