Thought: 

    The thing happeing here is that the function `setupCounter()` is taking the `initialValue` then do the functionalities like increment and decrement over it.

    Then it returns the both the funtionalities

    Then by assinging to vaianble, will able to access the counter value.

    the count variable will be different for the both `counterOne` and `counterTwo` 

    as the closure has the property of state maintainence so the data will be stored respective to the variable.
