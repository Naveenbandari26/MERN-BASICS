Thought: 

`continue`: 
    this will skip the remaining work in the iteration and continues to next iteration.

`Break`
    this statement, will immeditely break/terminate the loop.

`second loop`:
    this will be giving output like, if the value is divisible by 5 then skips it and if the i values is greater than 15 then stops the loop.

    and prints every value, according to above conditions too.

`Challenge`: 
    initially, prints `10` but next it dont print the 5 as we gave the condition like if num === 5 then skip/ continue

    then again it prints the `8` but with next value of num it stops iterating to other values, because we gave condition like if num value is greater than 12 break.
